Margin collapsing
Depending on whether two elements whose margins touch have positive or negative margins, the results will be different:

    ->Two positive margins will combine to become one margin. Its size will be equal to the largest individual margin.
    ->Two negative margins will collapse and the smallest (furthest from zero) value will be used.
    ->If one margin is negative, its value will be subtracted from the total.
