Flexbox
    --> it will try to fit evenything in one line with using least space.

    --> width = max-content this will only take the place of content but will not allow the wrap
    --> width = min-content this will only take the place of content but will allow the wrap

    flexbox allow both max and min content 

    flex: 1; ==> flex:  1 1 0%;

    flexgrow 1   =>equally distribute the space in all flexbox item 0 will not grow
    flex shrink 1 => will shrink the item in available space of comtaine allowing squishing 0 will not shrink
    flex-wrap wrap => rather squishing make the single item content on same line but will move the other item to next


 Axes
   -flexbox can be set to horizontal with row (default)
   -or we can set it to colomn => in this case keep in mind that
            if flex is 1 then the div may collapse and we got nothing it is because the it will set flexbasis to zero which will only fill the height of item div
            also keep in mind if you set the height to zero then same will happen

   - when we changed the flex-direction to column, flex-basis refers to height instead of width
   -Because justify-content and align-items are based on the main and cross axis of your container, 
   their behavior changes when you change the flex-direction of a flex-container. 

   if you want to align accodingto direction then 
   justifyContent flex-start, space-around 
   and if you alignment on opposite axes of direction align-items center

Gap
 Setting gap on a flex container simply adds a specified space between flex items
